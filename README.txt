SE206 Beta Version

Within the spellorama folder, there is a database file that holds the current data,
a folder containing premade .tldr files, and python files the contribute to the
running of the program

There are still additions that need to be made to the project such as improvement 
to the student interface and allowing the teacher to view the results of indervidual
lists that the student does.

Move to the directory of the unzipped file via the terminal then use:
./project1.sh
to run the program

If the shell script or python script does not run from the shell script:
Move into the spellorama folder and type "python project.py"

current student login for use has username=q and password=q
current teacher login for use has username=a and password=a

If you would like to create a new teacher account, the teacher password is "engineering"
